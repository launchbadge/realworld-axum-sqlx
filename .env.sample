# This is the URL that SQLx will use to make connections to the Postgres database.

# If you set up the Postgres server as instructed in `README.md` then all you should have to do here is replace

# This is the HMAC key that will be used to sign login tokens (JWTs).
# It just needs to be a random string, preferably at least 48 characters long to provide sufficient
# brute-force resistance.
#
# If you have OpenSSL installed, try `openssl rand -base64 48`
#
# Or, just search Google for a secure password generator.

# This variable is read by `env_logger`, not the application itself, so it won't appear on the `Config` struct.

# The value here enables log messages from the backend application as well as log messages emitted for incoming
# requests.
